"""
File objects used by the interpreter for standard input, output and errors:

stdin is used for all interactive input (including calls to input());

stdout is used for the output of print() and expression statements and for the prompts of input();

The interpreterâ€™s own prompts and its error messages go to stderr.

These streams are regular text files like those returned by the open() function.
